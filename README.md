## About this app

Gomoku is a two player board game where the objective is to get a line of 5
consecutive pieces of your colour. Players take turns placing a stone
anywhere on the board until a player wins or the board is full. Winning lines
may be in a row, column or diagonal.

I am writing this app as a university project. In its current state it just
draws a board and allows mouse clicks to change the colour of a game piece,
but it will be completed soon.
